# README #
This README is for the chess project where I will explain how the program functions
and inputs neccesary to have it work

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repositery is for a text-based 2 player chess game
* Version 1.0

### How do I play this chess game? ###

* The instructions are the same as a regular online chess game where there is a chessboard and the user has to write the coordinates of the piece they want to move and coordinates of where they want this piece moved.

* If a move made by the user is illegal meaning the chess piece can't move to the new coordinate because that piece can't go there, this can be a situation where the player attempts to move the rook diagonally etc. 

* Another illegal move would be to make a move that puts the player's king in check, in these instances the program will output the message "Illegal move, try again!"

* If a checkmate is made, the program will print out "Checkmate" followed by "(Winning color) wins"
